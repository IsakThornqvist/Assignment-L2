# Reflection
The first issue I ran into was that I was not familiar with the canvas element at all, at first I started trying to make my canvas via a div but whern I later checked MDN and found out that the canvas element can work for my project it mkade it alot easier, I also have gotten experience with the diffrent methods that exist and can be used in combination with the canvas such as, stroke() and beginPath(), these methods made it super convinient to make for example the pen work correctly and the documentation around the methods was very great.

# Names in the code

# The longest method/function

# Reflection on the code quality

# Notes to self

pen.js

beginPath() = "Lift pen completely off paper and start fresh"
moveTo(x, y) = "Place pen at position x,y WITHOUT drawing"
lineTo(x, y) = "Draw line from current position to x,y"
stroke() = "Make the line visible/permanent"
